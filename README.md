# Lieferando Ranking API

A FastAPI-based service that tracks restaurant rankings on Lieferando.de. The API provides real-time ranking information and maintains a historical record of rankings for specified restaurants.

## Features

- üîç Real-time restaurant ranking lookup via API
- üìä Automated ranking tracking for specified restaurants
- üìÖ Historical ranking data storage
- ‚è±Ô∏è Configurable scheduling for rank tracking
- üê≥ Easy deployment with Docker

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose

That's it! Everything else is handled by the Docker containers.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaulKenntner/LANCH_Case_study.git
cd lieferando-ranking-api
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

### API Endpoint

Get the current ranking for a restaurant:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/rank/{restaurant_slug}
```

Example:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/rank/loco-chicken-i-frechen
```

Response:
```json
{
    "restaurant_slug": "loco-chicken-i-frechen",
    "rank": 2,
    "rating": "4.5"
}
```

### View Historical Rankings

Use the provided script to view ranking history:

```bash
docker exec -it lanch-web-1 python app/services/view_rankings.py --slug loco-chicken-i-frechen --days 7
```

This will output the ranking history for the specified restaurant over the last 7 days.


### Automated Tracking

The application automatically tracks rankings for configured restaurants every hour. To modify the tracked restaurants, edit the `restaurant_slugs` list in `app/utils/scheduler.py`:

```python
self.restaurant_slugs = [
    "loco-chicken-i-frechen",
    "loco-chicken-bielefeld",
    "happy-slice-suedstadt",
    "happy-slice-pizza-i-wandsbek-markt",
    # Add more restaurants as needed
]
```

## Configuration

Key configurations in `app/config.py`:
- `SCRAPING_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Time between ranking updates (default: 60)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `BASE_LIEFERANDO_URL`: Base URL for scraping

## Database Management

Reset the database:
```bash

docker exec -it lanch-web-1 python scripts/reset_db.py
```


## Important Notes

- The scraper works best with currently open restaurants
- Searching closed restaurants may result in longer processing times
- Restaurant slugs can be found in the Lieferando.de URL for the restaurant


## Troubleshooting

1. If the API returns 404:
   - Verify the restaurant slug is correct
   - Check if the restaurant is currently open

2. If the database is not updating:
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
   - Verify the scheduler is running
   - Reset the database if needed

## Development

To modify the scraping interval:
```python
# In app/config.py
SCRAPING_INTERVAL_MINUTES: int = 60
```
